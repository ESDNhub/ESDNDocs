# ESDN Documentation
Workflow and technical documentation for the Empire State Digital Network. General project documentation is available on our [website] (http://empirestate.digital/about/documentation/).

### ESDN Metadata Profile
ESDN maps all partner metadata to a set of MODS elements aligned with DPLA's [Metadata Application Profile] (http://dp.la/info/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MAPv4.pdf). 

The full ESDN Metadata Profile is available [here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IKKP7vnQMQKBOXpVefZ1EfGTm92uwUOnwlITAw6IFQ/edit?usp=sharing) in Google Sheets. 

An ESDN [mapping worksheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sPf9DNl4_ySbJvLyYbjy-2CuwR7729NIytShWb57qgc/edit?usp=sharing) is also available to assist in aligning partner metadata with ESDN and DPLA requirements.

### Heidrun Mappings
Mappings for ESDN from Heidrun, DPLA's metadata ingestion and QA system, are available [here] (https://github.com/dpla/heidrun-mappings/blob/master/heidrun/esdn_mods.rb). 

### DPLA MAP Crosswalks
Crosswalks for [DPLA MAP V. 4] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BzZvDOf4fgas3TD21xF40lu2pk2XW0k2pTGJKIt6438/edit#gid=1453046017) for each hub, including ESDN, are also available.

### QA Tools
ESDN has adapted tools from North Carolina's DPLA Service Hub, the [North Carolina Digital Heritage Center] (https://www.digitalnc.org/), for our partner's use.

### Sets for DPLA Harvesting
ESDN provides DPLA with a list of sets, organized by OAI setSpec from our REPOX instance, for harvesting on a bimonthly schedule. The current list of sets ready for harvesting is available in the *sets-for-DPLA-harvesting* folder.
