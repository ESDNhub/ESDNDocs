# ESDNDocs
Workflow and technical documentation for the Empire State Digital Network. General project documentation is available on our [website] (http://empirestate.digital/about/documentation/).

### ESDN MODS 
ESDN maps all partner metadata to a set of MODS elements aligned with DPLA's [Metadata Application Profile] (http://dp.la/info/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MAPv4.pdf). 

### Heidrun Mappings
Mappings for ESDN from Heidrun, DPLA's metadata ingestion and QA system, are available [here] (https://github.com/dpla/heidrun-mappings/blob/master/heidrun/esdn_mods.rb).

### Sets for Harvesting
ESDN provides DPLA with a list of OAI sets to harvest from our REPOX instance on a bi-monthly basis. The current list of sets is ready for harvesting by DPLA is available in the *sets-for-DPLA-harvesting* folder above.
